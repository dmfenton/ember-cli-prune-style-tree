# ember-cli-prune-style-tree

This addon will pass a tree containing only `app/styles` to any addon that is run after it in the styles pipeline. It is meant to be used with [ember-cli-sass](https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass). It would be effectively obsolete if https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass/issues/74 is resolved.

## Installation
`ember install ember-cli-prune-style-tree`
